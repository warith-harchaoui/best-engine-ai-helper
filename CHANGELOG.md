# Changelog

All notable changes to best-engine-ai-helper are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Depend on `os-helper` (`>=1.5.0`) and route all logging through it. Library
  modules now emit `osh.info` at their seams (catalog / hardware load, memory
  detection, recommendation picks, model pull/remove, Ralph iterations, chat
  dispatch) and `osh.warning` / `osh.error` on the failure paths (malformed
  YAML/JSON config, unknown chip, no model fitting the budget, failed inference
  requests, gate failures). `info` / `debug` are off by default and surface with
  the new `-v` / `-vv` flag on the CLI; warnings and errors always show.
- File management goes through `os-helper` helpers: `osh.file_exists` for the
  config / catalog presence checks and `osh.make_directory` in place of ad-hoc
  `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-31

Make the chosen model tags trivially consumable by downstream suite packages,
so model selection lives here (its rightful home) rather than being hard-coded
in each consumer.

### Added

- `config.py`: cheap, deterministic resolvers `text_model()` / `vision_model()`
  / `resolved_models()` / `load_config()`. Precedence is env override
  (`BEST_LLM_TEXT` / `BEST_LLM_VISION`, with the legacy `SPREZZATURE_LLM_*`
  spellings accepted) → the selection persisted by `pull` in
  `~/.best-engine-ai-helper/config.json` → a safe built-in default
  (`qwen3-vl:8b`). They never probe hardware and never raise, so they are safe
  to call at import time, in CI, and in tests. Exported from the package root.

### Changed

- `llm.py` transport now resolves its model tags through `config`, closing the
  gap where it read only `SPREZZATURE_LLM_*` and ignored a fresh `pull`
  selection persisted under `BEST_LLM_*`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-30

Hardware-aware recommendation that weighs memory, accelerator, and compute, and
emits a justifiable report in Markdown and JSON.

### Added

- `recommend.py`: the end-to-end algorithm. Takes a hardware description, the
  benchmark catalog, and a (possibly vague, free-text) task, and returns the
  best engine per needed kind (LLM/VLM), each justified by task fit, memory fit,
  and estimated throughput. `parse_task` maps a phrase to a benchmark axis and
  the model kinds it needs. `to_markdown` / `write_report` render the result;
  the report round-trips through JSON.
- `report` CLI command: `--task "…" --out <stem> [--format md|json]` writes
  `<stem>.md` and `<stem>.json`.
- `detect.compute_profile()` and `detect.chip_name()`: accelerator kind and
  Apple-Silicon memory bandwidth (published specs), used for the throughput
  estimate.
- `score.estimated_tokens_per_second()`: bandwidth-bound decode-speed estimate.

### Changed

- **Memory budget model.** `effective_budget` now applies the Apple Metal
  GPU-usable cap (~66% ≤36 GB, ~75% >36 GB of unified memory) instead of
  treating the whole pool as usable, then a default `headroom` of 0.85 (was a
  flat 0.80 of everything) for the OS, workload, and KV growth. This stops the
  tool from steering toward RAM-maxing models that leave no room to work.
- Reliability: model-call timeout is now bounded and configurable via
  `SPREZZATURE_LLM_TIMEOUT` (default 120s, was a fixed 600s), so validation
  terminates predictably on a light model.

### Fixed

- Stale CLI test that treated the implemented `pull` / `validate` commands as
  stubs and hung the suite by driving the live model loop.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-28

First release. Phase 0a: pure Python, no model download required.

### Added

- Hardware detection (`detect.py`): Apple Silicon unified memory, NVIDIA VRAM via
  nvidia-smi, AMD VRAM via rocm-smi, CPU-only fallback via psutil.
- Model catalog (`catalog.py`, `models.yaml`): 13-entry bundled seed covering
  Qwen 3 VL (4B to 72B), Qwen 3 text (8B to 72B Q8), Qwen 2.5 3B, Gemma 3 12B.
  Cache-merge logic for future `catalog update` output.
- Hardware chip table (`hardware.py`, `hardware.yaml`): Apple Silicon M1 through
  M4 Ultra across all memory tiers; NVIDIA RTX 3060 through H100. Cache-merge logic.
- Selection algorithm (`score.py`): filters by 80% headroom, ranks by benchmark
  score (vision for VLMs, general for LLMs), last-resort smallest-model fallback.
- CLI (`cli.py`): `detect`, `recommend`, `catalog show`, `hardware show` commands
  fully implemented. `pull`, `validate`, `env`, `catalog update`, `hardware update`
  stubbed with Phase 0b notice.
- Test suite: 40+ tests in `tests/` covering all public functions.
